I m following: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwdty9jQN0E&list=PLrnPJCHvNZuDihTpkRs6SpZhqgBqPU118&index=2
1. Adding components to your project : https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/adding-components
2. If are using xAndroid then you may need to map artifact. check in here : https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/migrate
3. I m using 27 version. For higher version compulsory i have to use xAnddroid functionality. I will check it later

Architecture components are:
    1. Data Binding
    2. Lifecycle
    3. LiveData
    4. Navigation
    5. Paging
    6. Room
    7. ViewModel
    8. Work Manager

- see mvvm_arch_model.png in drawable.xml folder

Coding flow:
1. Add necessary dependencies like lifecycle component, room component
2. We will create "Entity" that is Node class
3. We will create DAO (Data Access Object) interface or abstract class
4. Now we have created "Entity" and "DAO". Now we will create "Room" database which will connect "Entity" and "DAO".
5. We will create "Repository"
6. We will create "ViewModel"
7. Now we will use "ViewModel" in activity
